TEA5767 FM Tuner + Raspberry Pi Debug Report
===========================================

Summary:
--------
I am attempting to use a TEA5767 FM radio module with a Raspberry Pi (model: [fill in model, e.g. Pi 3B+]). The goal is to tune and receive FM audio using Python and the smbus library. Despite following standard wiring and software procedures, I am unable to communicate with the module via I2C: all attempts to write to the device at address 0x60 result in `[Errno 121] Remote I/O error`. I2C detection tools do see the device, but no actual communication is possible.

Symptoms:
---------
- `i2cdetect -y 1` shows address 0x60 (the TEA5767) present on the bus.
- All Python I2C writes/reads to 0x60 fail with `[Errno 121] Remote I/O error`.
- No audio or static is heard from the module.
- SDA and SCL lines idle at 3.0V (measured with multimeter).
- Power cycling and re-checking wiring does not resolve the issue.

Wiring/Pinout:
--------------
TEA5767 module pins:
- 5V+   (power in)
- GND   (ground)
- SDA   (I2C data)
- SCL   (I2C clock)

Connections to Raspberry Pi:
- 5V+  -> Pi 5V (physical pin 2 or 4)
- GND  -> Pi GND (physical pin 6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34, or 39)
- SDA  -> Pi SDA (GPIO 2, physical pin 3)
- SCL  -> Pi SCL (GPIO 3, physical pin 5)

Notes:
- No other pins (RESET, STBY, EN, etc.) are present or connected on this module.
- Pull-up resistors: Not visible, but lines idle at 3V, suggesting pull-ups are present (either on module or Pi).
- Only the power pin is at 5V; all logic lines are at 3.0V.

Software:
---------
Python 3.x, smbus library. Test script:

import smbus
import time

TEA5767_ADDR = 0x60
FREQS = [100.1]  # Test FM frequency
SETTLE_S = 0.15

def _calc_bytes(freq_mhz):
    pll = int(4 * ((freq_mhz * 1_000_000) + 225_000) / 32_768)
    data0 = (pll >> 8) & 0x3F
    data1 = pll & 0xFF
    data2 = 0b00110000  # MUTE=0 (unmuted), search=0, stereo=1, soft mute=0
    data3 = 0b00010000
    data4 = 0x00
    return [data0, data1, data2, data3, data4]

bus = smbus.SMBus(1)
for freq in FREQS:
    try:
        bus.write_i2c_block_data(TEA5767_ADDR, 0, _calc_bytes(freq))
    except Exception as exc:
        print(f"{freq} MHz -> WRITE ERROR: {exc}")
        continue
    time.sleep(SETTLE_S)
    try:
        status = bus.read_i2c_block_data(TEA5767_ADDR, 0, 5)
        print(f"{freq} MHz -> OK, status bytes: {status}")
    except Exception as exc:
        print(f"{freq} MHz -> wrote OK, status read failed: {exc}")

What works:
-----------
- I2C is enabled on the Pi (raspi-config > Interfacing Options > I2C).
- `i2cdetect` shows 0x60 after enabling I2C.
- No overvoltage or shorts on SDA/SCL.

What fails:
-----------
- Any Python smbus write/read to 0x60 returns `[Errno 121] Remote I/O error`.
- No audio/static from module.

Troubleshooting steps already tried:
------------------------------------
- Power-cycled both Pi and TEA5767 module.
- Verified wiring multiple times (see above).
- Measured SDA/SCL voltage (3.0V idle).
- Tried different FM frequencies and mute settings in code.
- No other I2C devices on the bus.

Questions for reviewer:
-----------------------
- Is there a required pull-up or wiring step missing?
- Should any other pins be connected or tied high/low?
- Is this module known to work at 3.3V I2C logic?
- Any other troubleshooting steps to try?
- Is the module likely defective?
